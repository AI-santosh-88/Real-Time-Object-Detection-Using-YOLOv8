üîñ Project Title:
Real-Time Object Detection Using YOLOv8 

üíº Business Use Case:
Automated Visual Surveillance and Object Tracking

Businesses and organizations increasingly rely on computer vision to automate tasks like monitoring public spaces, improving workplace safety, detecting intrusions, or analyzing customer behavior in retail. This project applies YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) ‚Äî a real-time object detection model ‚Äî to identify and classify objects from a video feed, which can be adapted for various use cases including:

* Retail analytics (customer counting, activity tracking)

* Smart city surveillance (traffic monitoring, anomaly detection)

* Industrial safety (PPE detection, machine monitoring)

* Content moderation (automatic filtering in videos)


üìÑ Project Description:
This project uses the Ultralytics YOLOv8 model to detect and classify objects from a video file. It runs on Google Colab, utilizing PyTorch with CUDA acceleration to process video frames in real-time. Detected objects are labeled with class names and bounding boxes, and the results are displayed within the notebook.

üìå Summary:
This project demonstrates an end-to-end real-time object detection pipeline using YOLOv8 in a Google Colab environment. It captures frames from a video, runs inference, draws bounding boxes for each detected object, and displays annotated frames in a loop. The solution is flexible and scalable, making it applicable in several business contexts, especially where automation of visual tasks is valuable.
